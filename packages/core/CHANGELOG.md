# @avodado/core

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Agentic blocks, 106-pattern library, the full shape language, and a restructured skill. **AI & agents family** (79 → 83 blocks): `agentloop` (agent + tools + memory with numbered loop arrows and a stop-condition pill), `trace` (execution transcript with thinking and tool calls), `prompt` (prompt anatomy with highlighted `{{variables}}`), `context` (context-window token budget bar with overflow) + an Agent-system-doc playbook. **Design library 80 → 106**: interpreter (the 23rd GoF), architecture classics (mvc, mvvm, dependency-injection, unit-of-work, active-record, data-mapper, event-bus, specification, null-object), resilience/concurrency/messaging (retry-backoff, bulkhead, timeout, cache-aside, throttling, actor-model, producer-consumer, thread-pool, competing-consumers, splitter-aggregator), and agentic patterns (plan-and-execute, human-in-the-loop, agentic-rag, swarm-handoff, chain-of-thought, context-compaction). **Diagram elegance**: labeled C4 edges (and dense block-family diagrams) render as circled step numerals with a legend below; C4 tech renders as a chip; all node cards drop the left accent bar for the clean rounded agent-card look. **Shape language, 21 silhouettes by kind**: cylinder, tiered cylinder (warehouse), pail (S3), sharded trio, replica set, pipe, cloud, hexagon (gateway), octagon (lb), instance stack (cache + worker pools), server rack, shield (waf), actor figure, crowd, browser window, phone, ƒ circle (lambda), clock (cron), vault dial (secrets), globe (region), clean card — plus new kinds shard/replica/users/crowd/region/geo. **Skill restructured** for progressive disclosure: a 598-line hub (down from 2,373) + `reference/` spokes (blocks contract, system design, decks, and new per-document intake checklists with a batched ask-back protocol); `avo skill`, the Copilot adapter, and the MCP embed stitch everything into one prompt; `avo init` installs the full folder. **Plus**: a new `archmap` block (83 → 84) — the target-architecture capability mosaic with status-coded tiles (current/target/new/gap/deprecated) and an auto-legend; the shape language extends into `belogic`/`felogic` (db → cylinder, queue → pipe, cache → stack, external → cloud), `c4` (`store` → true database cylinder), and `cluster`; secrets render as a padlock and schedulers as the industry-standard calendar-with-clock; the ERD is restyled (tinted header band, content-sized entities, zebra rows, PK/FK chips); and block titles no longer render twice (the section head owns the title; the block body's duplicate header is suppressed at top level).
- The documentation-tool release. **New commands**: `avo serve` (zero-dep live-reload dev server — watch, SSE reload, in-page diagnostics banner), `avo build` (docs/ → a static site: index cards, sidebar nav with per-doc sections, cross-doc `doc#id` refs rewritten to real links), `avo mcp` (setup snippets + `--stdio` server), `avo install <tool>` (claude/cursor/copilot/windsurf — replaces the old per-tool commands, Copilot correctly named), `avo tour` (interactive 7-chapter terminal onboarding with a live-caught planted bug), `avo demo [family]` (filtered showcases with an interactive picker). **Removed**: the duplicate `render` command (use `html`). **Render**: blocks with an `id:` emit real anchors + `data-block-id`; userstory/stories ref chips are real links; C4 goes professional (level-aware `C4 · CONTAINER` tag, centered structurizr-style typography, dashed externals, legend derived from the kinds present, taller cards) and the layered architecture drops its solid label slabs for tinted zone bands with optional per-layer `color`. **Catalog** groups all blocks by family. **Skill**: `reference/blocks/` per-family split with INDEX + whole contract table (coverage-tested), trimmed trigger frontmatter, new "Organizing a documentation set" + "Reviewing an existing doc" + "C4 done right" guides. **Slides** gain an automated gate (full-demo deck + split-layout tests). New professional cfonts wordmark + one-line banner (ANSI-free when piped) and purpose-grouped help.
- Twelve more blocks (67 → 79) plus consulting-style decks. **Engineering & decisions**: `waterfall` (latency/cost budget cascade with a dashed budget line and over/under chip), `heatmap` (numeric grid with intensity ramp + legend), `scorecard` (weighted decision matrix with computed totals and winner highlight), `risk` (register with likelihood × impact severity chips), and `chart` gains a `radar` kind. **Design system** (new family): `palette` (color-token swatches with auto-contrast labels), `typescale` (live type specimen), `dodont` (Do/Don't guideline cards), `inventory` (component status board) + a Design-system doc playbook in the skill. **Algorithms & data structures** (new family): `array` (cells, indices, pointer labels, window highlight), `linkedlist` (singly/doubly with head/curr markers), `bintree` (binary tree with per-node walkthrough states), `hashmap` (buckets + collision chains); `graph` gains node `state` (visited/current/frontier/target) and edge `weight` for BFS/Dijkstra walkthroughs. **Decks**: `{split}` heading marker renders the consulting layout (message left, exhibit right), every slide gets a footer (deck title · page number), and the skill gains a Consulting-style decks section (action titles → one exhibit → takeaway). Also fixes `avo <cmd> | head` leaving an unsettled flush await.
- Fourteen new block types — the catalog grows from 53 to 67. **Everyday primitives**: `chart` (bar / line / area / donut, pure SVG), `figure` (image + caption), `diff` (unified +/− code diff on the dark editor surface), `steps` (numbered runbook stepper with per-step commands), `faq` (Q&A accordions). **System design**: `envelope` (back-of-envelope capacity math — assumptions → derivation rows → highlighted result), `slo` (service objectives with error-budget burn bars), `terminal` (shell session, distinct from code). **Business & strategy**: `swot`, `funnel` (conversion trapezoids with stage-to-stage %), `okr` (objectives + key-result progress bars), `persona` (user persona cards), `changelog` (release rail with typed change chips), `team` (people cards). All fully registered: strict schemas, renderers + CSS in the house style, `avo block` scaffolds, catalog descriptions, demo showcase sections, and skill documentation (glossary, contract table, examples, new Business & strategy family).
- Presentation text blocks + a full template set. **Three new blocks (84 → 87)**: `divider` (deck part-break interstitial — kicker, big title, accent wash), `bignumber` (the hero-stat slide: one huge figure + claim + context), `takeaways` (numbered presentation-scale closing statements). Dividers render full-width on slides; blocks whose title _is_ the visual no longer have it lifted into the section head; `{split}`/`{top}` heading markers no longer leak into HTML doc headings. **`avo template` grows from 1 to 11**: adr, design-doc, runbook, roadmap, api-spec, system-design, agent-system, design-system, postmortem, data-model, and a `deck` template demonstrating the consulting formula (divider → `{split}` argument slides → bignumber → takeaways) — every template schema-validated by tests and namespaced so several scaffold cleanly into one repo. The skill's deck guide covers when to use each, and the playbooks table maps each playbook to its template.
- System-design diagram overhaul. **Quick mode**: `col`/`row` are now optional on the block family, `graph`, and `felogic`/`belogic` — omit coordinates and the layout is computed from the edges. **Canonical shapes by kind**: db/store/warehouse render as cylinders, queue/topic/stream as horizontal-cylinder pipes, cdn/external as clouds, gateway/lb/proxy as hexagons, cache/redis as stacked-instance cards. **~40 new node kinds** with glyphs (dns, waf, auth/idp, monitor, scheduler, stream, warehouse, search, ml/llm/agent, vm, secrets, notification, email, ci, git, registry, device, analytics, config, …) plus vendor aliases (postgres/mysql/mongo→db, kafka/kinesis→stream, s3, sqs, redis, elasticsearch). **C4**: edge `tech:` labels, multiple named `boundaries[]`, and a fix for edge labels never rendering. **Cluster**: namespaces now sit side by side, self-sized, in the refined zone style. **UML**: content-sized class cards with tinted header compartments. **Polish**: nested infra zone labels no longer overlap, off-palette ink normalized to theme vars, graph label clamping, slide decks render text at presentation scale with a proper measure (text-only slides no longer over-scale). Skill updated throughout.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- New `gallery` block (now 53): a real grid (2 columns by default; set `cols` for
  3–4) of cells. Each cell is a syntax-highlighted code snippet, a note, or a
  **nested block** (`block: { type: c4, …data }`) — so you can lay out a bug gallery
  of code or compare several architectures/diagrams side by side. Nested blocks are
  validated against their own schema. Skill, `avo block`/`avo catalog`, and the
  showcase updated.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add three new block types (now 52):
  - **`list`** — a fancy bullet list with four marker styles (`accent` bar,
    `check`, `icon`, `number`); each item has a bold lead + optional supporting line.
  - **`stories`** — a collapsible backlog of user stories rendered as native
    `<details>` accordions (no JavaScript) in a single section; supports cross-doc
    `links[].ref`.
  - **`pattern`** — a GoF-style design-pattern reference card (intent · forces ·
    participants · consequences), for backend/architecture-pattern tutorials.

  Also: the `meta` block gains an optional **`logo`** field that renders in the
  document and slide cover. The getting-started doc gains the logo + an `avo skill`
  reference; a new `docs/tutorial.md` deck and a `docs/be-pattern-repository.md`
  tutorial show the new blocks. Skill, `avo block` templates, and `avo demo`
  showcase updated for all three.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add presentation blocks, `avo prompt`, and diagram-quality fixes.
  - **New blocks (49 total):** `drivers` (factor cards with icon + accent + tag),
    `options` (approaches explored — pros/cons/verdict, chosen highlighted), and
    `spec` (labelled spec sheet with an inline step-flow row).
  - **`avo prompt`** — ready-to-paste authoring prompts wired to the Document
    Playbooks (adr · situation · roadmap · cloud · rbac · api · design · runbook ·
    presentation). `avo prompt list`, `avo prompt <name>`, and `avo prompt new <name>`
    for saved custom prompts. In a terminal it copies to the clipboard; piped, it
    just prints (so `avo prompt adr | pbcopy` works).
  - **Diagram quality:** `block`/`infra` and `felogic`/`belogic` node labels now wrap
    and centre (no overflow/overlap); `swimlane` lane labels wrap; `composition` gets
    coloured per-gate cards with optional `kicker`/`source`; `belogic` kinds render
    UML stereotypes («controller» «service» «repository» «adapter» «gateway»).
  - **Skill:** the three new blocks documented (glossary, field reference, family
    examples) and a **Document playbooks** section mapping a one-line ask to a block
    stack; counts updated to 49.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add three access-control block types and give the CLI some flair.
  - **New blocks (46 total):** `matrix` (role × resource capability grid; cells tint
    by permission level), `anatomy` (the labelled parts of a delimited string such as
    `app:feature:action`), and `composition` (effective access as intersected gates,
    `gate₁ ∩ gate₂ ∩ … = result`). All three are theme-aware HTML/CSS.
  - **CLI:** interactive `avo html|slides|pdf|theme` (and `-p` preview) now show a
    per-action banner — an ASCII avocado next to the action word in avocado-green
    cfonts, plus a fun status line — instead of the generic wordmark.
  - **Slides:** `fit()` now measures with `getBoundingClientRect`, so diagrams
    (incl. inline SVG) scale to fit without being clipped.
  - **Docs:** SKILL.md catalog, family sections, strict field reference, and
    block-selection tables updated for all new blocks; counts corrected to 46.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- - **Removed the `funnel` block** (catalog is now 43). Use `stats`, `gantt`, or a `table` instead.
  - **`pyramid` fixed** — wider flat apex and theme-derived colors so labels no longer get cut off.
  - **New `avo theme [name]` command** — interactive picker (with the cfonts banner) or `avo theme dark` to set it directly; writes `avodado.theme.json`, including a `custom` scaffold.
  - **`avo html` / `avo slides` / `avo pdf`** now show the avocado cfonts banner and a fun status line (interactive only).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Gap-filling blocks (inspired by replicating a rich design doc), bringing the catalog to **44**:
  - **`pullquote`** — a standout pull-quote with optional attribution.
  - **`layers`** — a layered explanation: N numbered layers, each with a kicker / title / source / question + body (e.g. an L1/L2/L3 model).
  - **`callout` gains a `success` tone** (green).
  - **`userstory` is richer** — optional `title` and `tags`, shown as a header with the points pill.

  All wired through the schema, renderer, `avo new` templates, and the authoring skill.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a dedicated **`endpoint`** block — a Swagger-style API endpoint card. One block captures an HTTP operation: `method` + `path`, optional `title`/`description`/`auth`, `params` (path/query/header/cookie), request-`body` fields, `responses` (status + description + example), and optional `request`/`response` examples. Method and status codes are colour-coded. The block catalog is now 42 types; `avo new --type endpoint` scaffolds a starter, and the authoring skill documents it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- - **Auto-layout for the coordinate diagrams.** `flow`/`dag`, `c4`, `state`, `dfd`, and `uml` no longer require `col`/`row` on every node — when coordinates are omitted, a clean layered grid is derived from the edges (dagre) so you can declare just nodes + relationships. Explicit `col`/`row` are still honored exactly (fully backward-compatible).
  - **ERD crow's-foot notation.** Relations now render proper crow's-foot ends (one / many) derived from `card`, and show the relation `label` on the edge. Added `N:1` to the `card` values (the common many-to-one shape).

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Replace the default theme with `minimal` — a clean, modern, Vercel-style look (white paper, near-black ink, a single `#0070f3` blue accent, geometric sans, subtle rounding). The `navy`/editorial theme is removed; `minimal` is now the default.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- aaa2610: Initial public release (0.0.1).
  - **@avodado/core** — parser, Zod schemas for all 41 block types, the typed block
    registry, document validator with precise diagnostics (line/column, did-you-mean,
    hints), and the cross-document reference resolver.
  - **@avodado/render** — `renderDocument` (standalone styled HTML) and
    `renderDocumentParts` (embeddable parts: CSS + body + sections) with inline SVG
    diagrams and 6 themes.
  - **@avodado/export** — HTML + PDF export (PDF via Playwright, optional).
  - **@avodado/cli** — the `avo` CLI: `init / new / check / render / preview / export /
sync`, with a code-frame diagnostics UI and the authoring skill scaffolder.
  - **@avodado/sync** — generate Avodado docs from external sources (OpenAPI).
  - **@avodado/mcp** — Model Context Protocol server exposing the doc tooling to any
    MCP client.
