## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 6837e18: Repaired flow-mapping values in the new templates that swallowed the keys after them.

  An unquoted YAML flow value containing a comma absorbs everything up to the
  closing brace, so `mitigation: Rehearsed twice, owner: Orders` parsed as one
  long `mitigation` string with no owner and no status. Every field involved is
  optional, so it validated cleanly and only showed up in the rendered document —
  a sequence message losing its `kind`, a risk row losing its owner.

  Twenty-six rows across seven templates are fixed, and a test now rejects the
  pattern at the source rather than waiting for someone to notice the render.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 61a3371: Templates are finished documents now, and there are eighteen of them.

  `avo template adr` used to hand you a form — `ADR-NNN`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, "what
  forces a decision here?". It now hands you a real decision record about
  idempotency keys on a payments API, with the forces that drove it, the sequence
  that shows the mechanism, three options weighed, the architecture, consequences,
  risks and a rollout. You edit a document instead of filling in a shape.

  **Seven new templates**, all written the same way: `migration-plan` (before/after,
  phases, the cutover runbook, rollback, risks), `threat-model` (scope, the data
  flow across the trust boundary, STRIDE threats, controls, tests),
  `service-overview` (the page you want at 3am — owner, architecture, SLOs,
  dependencies, common operations), `release-notes` (highlights, changelog,
  breaking changes, upgrade steps, deprecations), `test-plan` (scope, the case
  matrix, environments, suite status, exit criteria), `onboarding` (local setup,
  the code map, how a request flows, who to ask) and `status-update` (an SCQA
  summary, the numbers, workstreams, the decisions being asked for).

  Studio's picker gained a filter — searchable by name, description and the block
  types a template uses — and the hosted studio understands `?template=<name>`, so
  a link opens straight into a prefilled document with no picker in between.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 7f969a3: Two blocks a consulting deck opens and closes with, and three fixes to how a
  slide handles text. 84 → 86 types.
  - **`harvey`** — the rated comparison grid: options across the top, criteria
    down the side, a Harvey ball (0–4) for each judgement. The WEIGHTED footer is
    computed from the balls, so the column marked `recommend` and the arithmetic
    can be seen to agree. A row shorter than `columns` reads as _not assessed_
    rather than as a zero — different claims. Use `benchmark` for measured
    numbers, `harvey` for judgements.
  - **`scqa`** — the executive summary in Minto order: situation, complication,
    question, answer. Every field is optional but the order is fixed, which is
    the block's job; `answer` takes the filled card and `because` hangs the
    support beneath it.

  **Slides:** a block's `lede` used to vanish on a slide — it lives in the
  section head, which the stage hides. It now pins under the slide title as the
  supporting line of an action title, at a fixed size so the fitter can't shrink
  it with the exhibit. Body copy also moves to presentation sizes (19px prose,
  17.5px list items, 19.5px in a `{split}` message column) with the measure still
  capped, because long lines are harder to follow on a screen, not easier.

- f56bbac: The four pieces a consulting deck still needed. 86 → 87 types.
  - **`scenarios`** — base, upside and downside against the same drivers. Cases
    in columns, so reading across a driver row shows how much of the outcome
    hangs on that assumption; the base case is badged because every other column
    is read relative to it, and `outcome` gets its own emphasised row. A case
    that omits a driver renders `·` — silent about it, which is not the same as
    claiming no change.
  - **`tree` becomes a driver tree** when its nodes carry `value`. Each node
    shows its number and **its share of its parent** — p95 = capture (74%) +
    order write (16%) + the rest. No new block: values turn the hierarchy into
    arithmetic, the way `gauge` went into `chart`.
  - **`## Title {source: production traces, 14 Oct 2026}`** puts a source line in
    the slide footer, where every consulting exhibit carries one. It lives in the
    footer rather than under the block on purpose: the fitter scales the exhibit,
    and provenance that shrinks with it stops being readable.
  - **A deck tracker.** Two or more `divider` bands and the slide header grows a
    "you are here" strip — the parts of the deck with the current one lit. One
    divider draws nothing; a strip of one says nothing.

- 4f4811e: Five new block types and two new chart kinds — the shapes a technical doc still
  had to draw somewhere else. The library goes 79 → 84.
  - **`gitgraph`** — the branching and release model. Lanes for branches, dots
    for commits, a solid curve where one forks and a dashed one where it merges
    back, tags for releases. Commits are a plain sequence, so the YAML reads in
    the order the history happened; the first commit on an unseen branch opens
    its lane.
  - **`treemap`** — proportional composition where a donut gives up. Squarified
    layout (near-square tiles, biggest first) makes areas comparable by eye, so
    thirty services by spend stay readable.
  - **`packet`** — a wire format bit by bit, the diagram an RFC draws in ASCII.
    Cell width IS the bit count, and a field that overruns its row wraps and
    continues on the next, marked `→` / `(cont.)`.
  - **`venn`** — two or three overlapping sets with the shared regions labelled,
    for scope, ownership and responsibility.
  - **`wardley`** — components placed by visibility to the user and by evolution
    (genesis → commodity), joined into a value chain, with `movement` for where
    one is heading.
  - **`chart` `kind: stacked`** — columns that sum instead of standing side by
    side; the axis scales to the totals and each column is labelled with its own.
  - **`chart` `kind: scatter`** — the same series as unjoined points, for when x
    order carries no meaning.

  Also: schema introspection now reports an array's declared `.min(n)`, and the
  Studio form seeds that many items when it adds one. A form that produced fewer
  was building a value its own schema would reject — `venn.shared.sets` (min 2)
  is the first field to require it.

- 35059ea: Two additions from a pass over the whole library, looking for what a technical
  doc still can't draw.

  **New `sankey` block — how much moves between stages.** `flow` and `dfd` show
  that a path exists; nothing showed how heavy it is. Node height and ribbon
  thickness are the same scale, so the widest ribbon leaving a stage IS where the
  volume goes: cloud spend by service, traffic by route, a funnel with its
  drop-off. Nodes are inferred from the links, so the minimum body is a list of
  `from -> to: value`; declare `nodes` only to relabel, colour, or pin a column.
  A node's column is the longest link chain reaching it, so a stage always sits
  right of everything feeding it.

  **New `chart` kind: `gauge` — radial progress against a ceiling.** A donut says
  how a whole splits up; a gauge says how far along one number is, which is the
  shape an SLO, a quota, a migration or a rollout actually has. `max` is the full
  sweep (default 100, the percentage case). One item draws a single dial with the
  value in the middle; several become concentric rings with a legend.

  The block count goes 78 → 79.

### Patch Changes

- a9213cf: `{source: …}` no longer leaks into a page heading. The deck stripped it; the
  document renderer only knew the alignment markers, so `## Title {source: …}`
  rendered the marker verbatim on the page.

  The three places that had to agree about what a heading says now share one
  definition in `@avodado/core` (`stripHeadingMarkers`, `readSourceMarker`,
  `readAlignMarker`) — the page renderer, the deck, and `trailingHeading`, which
  feeds block titles and the sections nav and stripped nothing at all.

  On a page the source isn't dropped, it's printed: a small provenance line under
  the heading, matching what the deck puts in the slide footer.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 6294435: New **`benchmark`** block — measured results side by side, in the shape model
  cards and vendor comparisons use: subject columns × metric rows, each metric
  carrying the benchmark's own name under its label.

  The winner in each row is **derived, not authored**: the numbers are read out of
  the cells (`$0.14`, `310 ms`, `1861` and `43.3%` all compare), then bolded and
  tinted. `better: low` flips it for latency and cost, `better: none` turns it
  off, and `best: true` forces a tie or a non-numeric winner. `featured: true`
  outlines one subject's whole column; `tone: muted` tints a rival's win gray so
  it doesn't read as your win. A row measured under several conditions names them
  in `variants` and gives each subject one value per condition — they stack in
  the cell, captioned, and each condition is compared on its own line.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 2cde519: Diagrams auto-lay out **left-to-right** instead of top-to-bottom. A `flow` or
  `c4` written as just nodes + edges used to come back as a tall column of ranks
  that outgrew the page and shrank to a thin strip on a slide; it now runs across
  the page, matching `state`, `dfd`, `felogic`, and `block`, which already did.

  New `dir: LR | TB` on `flow`, `state`, `dfd`, `c4`, `felogic`, and `block` asks
  for the other direction — it steers the auto-layout only, so diagrams with
  `col`/`row` on their nodes render exactly as before. The showcase's `variant:
dag` pipeline and the authoring skill were updated to match.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 0451174: Slides: the stage-column treatment now covers every stacked text block —
  `agenda`, `spec`, `inventory`, `slo`, `okr`, and `risk` join list/takeaways/
  steps/faq/glossary/prose lists (2 columns at 4+ items, 3 at 8+). Blocks that
  are already grids (team, persona, drivers, gallery) or whose vertical order is
  the point (layers, changelog) are untouched. Also fixes the terse OKR
  key-result sugar: `· 60` / `· 60%` now lands as the schema's 0-1 fraction, so
  progress bars show the real percentage instead of clamping to 100%.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 402174b: **Terse sugar everywhere.** Eleven more fields accept one-line string items:
  - **Diagrams:** `dfd.edges`, `swimlane.links` + `lanes`, `c4.edges`,
    `cluster.links` take `a -> b: label`; `state.transitions` take
    `idle -> active: submit` (the label is the event); `flow`/`graph`/`block`/
    `dfd`/`state` **nodes** take `rx: Receive` — or just `Receive` (a bare name
    is both id and label, so a whole sketch is `nodes: [Receive, Check]` +
    `edges: [Receive -> Check]`); `erd` columns take `id uuid pk` /
    `org_id: uuid fk`.
  - **Cards:** `stats` take `p95 · 120ms · -30%` (trend inferred from the delta
    sign); `team.members` take `Ana · Backend · payments`; `agenda.items` take
    `09:00 · 20m · Standup — round robin` (time/duration detected by shape);
    `okr` key results take `[on-track] Signups · 60%`.

  Object forms are untouched and mix freely; the skill's terse-grammar table
  documents every form.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 3aca7b1: **Block audit: simpler authoring across the list-shaped blocks.** Six more
  blocks now take terse string items (the callout bare-text philosophy):
  - `glossary` — `SLO — the target` or unquoted `SLO: the target`
  - `faq` — `Why is it fast? — The cache is warm.`
  - `takeaways` — `Ship small — five beats one.`
  - `list` — `Lead` or `Lead — text`
  - `steps` — `Title` or `Title — body`
  - `kanban` cards — `Core parser` or `Validation · priority`

  Object forms are untouched; unquoted `Key: value` items (the YAML wrinkle) are
  rescued when the key isn't a real field. Also refiles `pullquote` and `layers`
  from the `api` family to `narrative` where they belong, and the skill's
  contract + examples teach the terse forms.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d9c992: **Callouts (and pullquotes) are now just text.** A text-first block's body can
  be plain prose — no YAML at all, so colons, quotes and dashes never need
  escaping:

      ```callout
      Heads up: the rate limit is 100 req/min — use `retry()` with **backoff**.
      ```

  The whole body becomes the block's text field (callout `body`, pullquote
  `text`), and it renders as inline Markdown (bold/italic/code/links, blank lines
  as paragraph breaks — hardened, no raw HTML). Leading with a known field
  (`tone:`, `title:`, `id:`…) still parses as YAML exactly as before. Studio's
  structured edits canonicalize a bare-text body to explicit fields instead of
  failing.

  **Typography: reading text is bigger.** Body prose 14 → 15.5px, list items
  13.5 → 15px, callout body 13 → 14.5px, glossary/diagram descriptions 13 → 14px,
  section ledes 15.5 → 16px.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 43a45ea: **The heading titles the block.** A `##` heading directly above a block now
  titles it: a near-duplicate block `title` is suppressed at render (no more two
  stacked headings saying the same thing — healed in HTML, slides, Studio, and
  PDF), and a title-less block inherits the heading into the sections nav. The
  Markdown-native way to write docs is now simply: put the title in the heading
  and skip `title:` in the YAML.

  The `W_DUP_HEADING` warning is removed (the condition is auto-healed), and core
  exports `trailingHeading` alongside `isNearDuplicateTitle`. The authoring skill
  teaches the new rule.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 7052a5d: Rename the CLI package `@avodado/cli` → **`avodado`** (unscoped) for
  discoverability: `npm i -g avodado`, `npx avodado`, and the command is available
  as both `avo` and `avodado`. `@avodado/cli` is deprecated and points here.

  Also improve the npm READMEs: the CLI README opens with a worked example (a
  Markdown doc with a `sequence` block → `avo check` / `avo html` / `avo studio`)
  in plainer language; the core README lists the real block-type set (77 across 12
  families) instead of a stale short list.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- ebdf605: Studio, rendering, and package metadata.

  **Studio**
  - Toolbar **Export** menu: download the current doc as a standalone HTML page,
    a self-contained slide deck, or a PDF. PDF is produced by a new
    `POST /api/export/pdf` route on the file-bridge server (headless Chromium).
  - **ERD drag-to-connect:** selecting an entity shows connector dots; dragging
    to another entity opens a cardinality picker (1:1 / 1:N / N:1 / N:M) that
    appends the relation. Committed as a single undo step.
  - Direct-manipulation editing for grid groups (marquee select + resize) and
    column-family blocks.

  **Rendering**
  - New `cycle` block and grid-group / orthogonal-lane / label-wrap improvements
    across the diagram renderers.

  **Metadata**
  - SEO-focused `description` + `keywords` across all packages, framed around the
    real use cases: API docs, architecture & system design, ERDs, ADRs, and
    slide/PDF presentations.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Simplification: 76 block types, terser YAML, a smaller CLI, and a sharper story — with zero breaking changes.

  **88 → 76 block types, 12 permanent aliases.** Twelve blocks that were variants of another block merged into their canonical type: `infra`/`event`/`ddd`/`network` → `block` (`preset:`), `belogic` → `felogic` (`variant: be`), `dag` → `flow` (`variant: dag`), `waterfall`/`funnel` → `chart` (`kind:`), `diff`/`terminal` → `code` (`kind:`), `mece` → `tree` (`variant: issue`), `tracker` → `statustable` (`variant: tracker`). **The old spellings stay valid forever**: an aliased fence parses to its canonical type with the variant fields injected (your body always wins on conflict), renders byte-identically to before (pinned parity fixtures), keeps its historical section eyebrow, and survives studio editing untouched. `avo check` surfaces a `W_ALIAS_TYPE` warning — informational only, never a failure — telling you where the type lives now. No file needs to change. (Further merges the audits suggested — matrix→table, heatmap→chart, gantt→timeline, and friends — were rejected: their data shapes are structurally different, and forcing them would have bolted second grammars onto flagship blocks.)

  **YAML sugar.** The chattiest blocks now take one-line string forms alongside the object form: sequence messages and flow/graph/block edges (`Client -> Server: request`, `-->` for response/dashed, `-x->` for error), ERD relations in crow's-foot (`users ||--o{ orders: places`), and timeline items (`[done] 2026-07 · Phase 1 · What shipped`). Input-only — files keep whatever form you wrote.

  **Scalar coercion.** Bare numbers and booleans in string-only positions coerce automatically — "expected string, received number" is gone where the intent was unambiguous, and positions that legitimately take numbers (table cells, stats values) are protected.

  **CLI redesign.** Twenty commands became ~13 in four groups — Work (`avo`, `init`, `new`, `check`, `studio`, `serve`), Output (`html`, `slides`, `pdf`, `build`), Discover (`explore`), Setup (`install`, `theme`, `mcp`, `sync`). Bare `avo` is now smart: outside a project it points you at `avo init`; inside one it shows a mini status and your next actions. `avo <file.md>` renders and opens the file. `avo new` unifies doc templates and block scaffolds (`avo new adr`, `avo new sequence` — old names resolve with an alias note). `avo explore` fronts demo/catalog/design/tour. Old command names keep working as hidden compat. `avo init` writes ~30 files instead of 104: the authoring skill installs once at `.avodado/skill/` and each AI tool gets a small pointer stub instead of a full copy.

  **Studio.** "+ New doc" opens a template picker — Blank plus the 11 doc templates (ADR, design doc, runbook, API spec, …) as cards; picking one creates the doc and opens the first content block's Edit Sheet so Tab/Enter walks you through filling it in. Insert search understands the old spellings: typing "waterfall" surfaces "Data chart — matches waterfall (kind: waterfall)" and inserts a chart with the variant pre-filled.

  **Positioning.** The lede everywhere is now the point: _your documentation has a schema_ — typed, fenced YAML blocks in plain Markdown, validated like code, with the `.md` files on disk as the only source of truth.

  `@avodado/mcp` picks up the regenerated skill embed and `list_block_types` now returns the canonical 76 plus the alias map.

- Studio becomes the single local surface, imports arrive, and the official mark
  ships everywhere.
  - studio: **Edit · Site · Present modes** — Site browses the real built docs
    site (live-reloading, cross-doc nav) inside studio; Present (⇧⌘P) shows the
    current doc as slides, unsaved edits included. **Block Library** — browse all
    blocks as cards with rendered previews, filter by family/search (old block
    spellings resolve), click through to a full preview + template and insert in
    one step. **Import by drag-drop**: a `.csv` becomes a filled table /
    status table / chart at the drop point (smart suggestion with reasoning); an
    OpenAPI `.yaml`/`.json` scaffolds a whole validated doc. Forms-first editing
    (spreadsheet-style table grid, Simple|Detailed union fields) and an
    interactive 9-step tour.
  - core: new `import/` module — dependency-free RFC-4180 CSV engine
    (`csvToTable` / `csvToStatustable` / `csvToChart` / `suggestCsvImport`), the
    OpenAPI generator relocated from the CLI (one source for cli, mcp, studio),
    and an importer registry.
  - cli: `avo sync csv <file>` (smart block pick, `--block/--delimiter/--title`);
    `avo serve` is now a hidden alias — `avo studio` (Site mode) is the one local
    surface.
  - render: every rendered page, deck, and site now carries the official avodado
    mark as its favicon.
  - mcp: imports the OpenAPI generator from core (vendored copy removed).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- `avo studio` — the visual doc editor. A full-screen local web app served by the
  CLI: insert blocks from the searchable palette into a live-rendered canvas, edit them
  via schema-generated forms or raw YAML, reorder with drag handles, and watch AI
  edits to the same files repaint live over SSE. Files on disk stay the single
  source of truth — studio surgically rewrites individual fenced blocks.
  - core: new surgical edit ops (`replaceBlockBody`, `insertBlock`, `removeSegment`,
    `moveSegment`, `setYamlPath`, …), schema introspection (`describeBlockSchema`),
    and the block catalog data (`BLOCK_TEMPLATES`, `BLOCK_DESCRIPTIONS`,
    `BLOCK_FAMILY`) relocated from the CLI as public API.
  - render: `renderDocumentSegments` — per-segment HTML index-aligned with
    `doc.segments`, for editors that need DOM↔segment mapping.
  - cli: new `avo studio` command — a localhost-only file-bridge server (JSON API +
    SSE + static app assets); shared fs-watch helpers extracted into `io/watch.ts`.
  - studio: first release of the web app (published as static assets consumed by
    the CLI).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Agentic blocks, 106-pattern library, the full shape language, and a restructured skill. **AI & agents family** (79 → 83 blocks): `agentloop` (agent + tools + memory with numbered loop arrows and a stop-condition pill), `trace` (execution transcript with thinking and tool calls), `prompt` (prompt anatomy with highlighted `{{variables}}`), `context` (context-window token budget bar with overflow) + an Agent-system-doc playbook. **Design library 80 → 106**: interpreter (the 23rd GoF), architecture classics (mvc, mvvm, dependency-injection, unit-of-work, active-record, data-mapper, event-bus, specification, null-object), resilience/concurrency/messaging (retry-backoff, bulkhead, timeout, cache-aside, throttling, actor-model, producer-consumer, thread-pool, competing-consumers, splitter-aggregator), and agentic patterns (plan-and-execute, human-in-the-loop, agentic-rag, swarm-handoff, chain-of-thought, context-compaction). **Diagram elegance**: labeled C4 edges (and dense block-family diagrams) render as circled step numerals with a legend below; C4 tech renders as a chip; all node cards drop the left accent bar for the clean rounded agent-card look. **Shape language, 21 silhouettes by kind**: cylinder, tiered cylinder (warehouse), pail (S3), sharded trio, replica set, pipe, cloud, hexagon (gateway), octagon (lb), instance stack (cache + worker pools), server rack, shield (waf), actor figure, crowd, browser window, phone, ƒ circle (lambda), clock (cron), vault dial (secrets), globe (region), clean card — plus new kinds shard/replica/users/crowd/region/geo. **Skill restructured** for progressive disclosure: a 598-line hub (down from 2,373) + `reference/` spokes (blocks contract, system design, decks, and new per-document intake checklists with a batched ask-back protocol); `avo skill`, the Copilot adapter, and the MCP embed stitch everything into one prompt; `avo init` installs the full folder. **Plus**: a new `archmap` block (83 → 84) — the target-architecture capability mosaic with status-coded tiles (current/target/new/gap/deprecated) and an auto-legend; the shape language extends into `belogic`/`felogic` (db → cylinder, queue → pipe, cache → stack, external → cloud), `c4` (`store` → true database cylinder), and `cluster`; secrets render as a padlock and schedulers as the industry-standard calendar-with-clock; the ERD is restyled (tinted header band, content-sized entities, zebra rows, PK/FK chips); and block titles no longer render twice (the section head owns the title; the block body's duplicate header is suppressed at top level).
- The documentation-tool release. **New commands**: `avo serve` (zero-dep live-reload dev server — watch, SSE reload, in-page diagnostics banner), `avo build` (docs/ → a static site: index cards, sidebar nav with per-doc sections, cross-doc `doc#id` refs rewritten to real links), `avo mcp` (setup snippets + `--stdio` server), `avo install <tool>` (claude/cursor/copilot/windsurf — replaces the old per-tool commands, Copilot correctly named), `avo tour` (interactive 7-chapter terminal onboarding with a live-caught planted bug), `avo demo [family]` (filtered showcases with an interactive picker). **Removed**: the duplicate `render` command (use `html`). **Render**: blocks with an `id:` emit real anchors + `data-block-id`; userstory/stories ref chips are real links; C4 goes professional (level-aware `C4 · CONTAINER` tag, centered structurizr-style typography, dashed externals, legend derived from the kinds present, taller cards) and the layered architecture drops its solid label slabs for tinted zone bands with optional per-layer `color`. **Catalog** groups all blocks by family. **Skill**: `reference/blocks/` per-family split with INDEX + whole contract table (coverage-tested), trimmed trigger frontmatter, new "Organizing a documentation set" + "Reviewing an existing doc" + "C4 done right" guides. **Slides** gain an automated gate (full-demo deck + split-layout tests). New professional cfonts wordmark + one-line banner (ANSI-free when piped) and purpose-grouped help.
- Twelve more blocks (67 → 79) plus consulting-style decks. **Engineering & decisions**: `waterfall` (latency/cost budget cascade with a dashed budget line and over/under chip), `heatmap` (numeric grid with intensity ramp + legend), `scorecard` (weighted decision matrix with computed totals and winner highlight), `risk` (register with likelihood × impact severity chips), and `chart` gains a `radar` kind. **Design system** (new family): `palette` (color-token swatches with auto-contrast labels), `typescale` (live type specimen), `dodont` (Do/Don't guideline cards), `inventory` (component status board) + a Design-system doc playbook in the skill. **Algorithms & data structures** (new family): `array` (cells, indices, pointer labels, window highlight), `linkedlist` (singly/doubly with head/curr markers), `bintree` (binary tree with per-node walkthrough states), `hashmap` (buckets + collision chains); `graph` gains node `state` (visited/current/frontier/target) and edge `weight` for BFS/Dijkstra walkthroughs. **Decks**: `{split}` heading marker renders the consulting layout (message left, exhibit right), every slide gets a footer (deck title · page number), and the skill gains a Consulting-style decks section (action titles → one exhibit → takeaway). Also fixes `avo <cmd> | head` leaving an unsettled flush await.
- Fourteen new block types — the catalog grows from 53 to 67. **Everyday primitives**: `chart` (bar / line / area / donut, pure SVG), `figure` (image + caption), `diff` (unified +/− code diff on the dark editor surface), `steps` (numbered runbook stepper with per-step commands), `faq` (Q&A accordions). **System design**: `envelope` (back-of-envelope capacity math — assumptions → derivation rows → highlighted result), `slo` (service objectives with error-budget burn bars), `terminal` (shell session, distinct from code). **Business & strategy**: `swot`, `funnel` (conversion trapezoids with stage-to-stage %), `okr` (objectives + key-result progress bars), `persona` (user persona cards), `changelog` (release rail with typed change chips), `team` (people cards). All fully registered: strict schemas, renderers + CSS in the house style, `avo block` scaffolds, catalog descriptions, demo showcase sections, and skill documentation (glossary, contract table, examples, new Business & strategy family).
- Presentation text blocks + a full template set. **Three new blocks (84 → 87)**: `divider` (deck part-break interstitial — kicker, big title, accent wash), `bignumber` (the hero-stat slide: one huge figure + claim + context), `takeaways` (numbered presentation-scale closing statements). Dividers render full-width on slides; blocks whose title _is_ the visual no longer have it lifted into the section head; `{split}`/`{top}` heading markers no longer leak into HTML doc headings. **`avo template` grows from 1 to 11**: adr, design-doc, runbook, roadmap, api-spec, system-design, agent-system, design-system, postmortem, data-model, and a `deck` template demonstrating the consulting formula (divider → `{split}` argument slides → bignumber → takeaways) — every template schema-validated by tests and namespaced so several scaffold cleanly into one repo. The skill's deck guide covers when to use each, and the playbooks table maps each playbook to its template.
- System-design diagram overhaul. **Quick mode**: `col`/`row` are now optional on the block family, `graph`, and `felogic`/`belogic` — omit coordinates and the layout is computed from the edges. **Canonical shapes by kind**: db/store/warehouse render as cylinders, queue/topic/stream as horizontal-cylinder pipes, cdn/external as clouds, gateway/lb/proxy as hexagons, cache/redis as stacked-instance cards. **~40 new node kinds** with glyphs (dns, waf, auth/idp, monitor, scheduler, stream, warehouse, search, ml/llm/agent, vm, secrets, notification, email, ci, git, registry, device, analytics, config, …) plus vendor aliases (postgres/mysql/mongo→db, kafka/kinesis→stream, s3, sqs, redis, elasticsearch). **C4**: edge `tech:` labels, multiple named `boundaries[]`, and a fix for edge labels never rendering. **Cluster**: namespaces now sit side by side, self-sized, in the refined zone style. **UML**: content-sized class cards with tinted header compartments. **Polish**: nested infra zone labels no longer overlap, off-palette ink normalized to theme vars, graph label clamping, slide decks render text at presentation scale with a proper measure (text-only slides no longer over-scale). Skill updated throughout.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- New `gallery` block (now 53): a real grid (2 columns by default; set `cols` for
  3–4) of cells. Each cell is a syntax-highlighted code snippet, a note, or a
  **nested block** (`block: { type: c4, …data }`) — so you can lay out a bug gallery
  of code or compare several architectures/diagrams side by side. Nested blocks are
  validated against their own schema. Skill, `avo block`/`avo catalog`, and the
  showcase updated.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add three new block types (now 52):
  - **`list`** — a fancy bullet list with four marker styles (`accent` bar,
    `check`, `icon`, `number`); each item has a bold lead + optional supporting line.
  - **`stories`** — a collapsible backlog of user stories rendered as native
    `<details>` accordions (no JavaScript) in a single section; supports cross-doc
    `links[].ref`.
  - **`pattern`** — a GoF-style design-pattern reference card (intent · forces ·
    participants · consequences), for backend/architecture-pattern tutorials.

  Also: the `meta` block gains an optional **`logo`** field that renders in the
  document and slide cover. The getting-started doc gains the logo + an `avo skill`
  reference; a new `docs/tutorial.md` deck and a `docs/be-pattern-repository.md`
  tutorial show the new blocks. Skill, `avo block` templates, and `avo demo`
  showcase updated for all three.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add presentation blocks, `avo prompt`, and diagram-quality fixes.
  - **New blocks (49 total):** `drivers` (factor cards with icon + accent + tag),
    `options` (approaches explored — pros/cons/verdict, chosen highlighted), and
    `spec` (labelled spec sheet with an inline step-flow row).
  - **`avo prompt`** — ready-to-paste authoring prompts wired to the Document
    Playbooks (adr · situation · roadmap · cloud · rbac · api · design · runbook ·
    presentation). `avo prompt list`, `avo prompt <name>`, and `avo prompt new <name>`
    for saved custom prompts. In a terminal it copies to the clipboard; piped, it
    just prints (so `avo prompt adr | pbcopy` works).
  - **Diagram quality:** `block`/`infra` and `felogic`/`belogic` node labels now wrap
    and centre (no overflow/overlap); `swimlane` lane labels wrap; `composition` gets
    coloured per-gate cards with optional `kicker`/`source`; `belogic` kinds render
    UML stereotypes («controller» «service» «repository» «adapter» «gateway»).
  - **Skill:** the three new blocks documented (glossary, field reference, family
    examples) and a **Document playbooks** section mapping a one-line ask to a block
    stack; counts updated to 49.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add three access-control block types and give the CLI some flair.
  - **New blocks (46 total):** `matrix` (role × resource capability grid; cells tint
    by permission level), `anatomy` (the labelled parts of a delimited string such as
    `app:feature:action`), and `composition` (effective access as intersected gates,
    `gate₁ ∩ gate₂ ∩ … = result`). All three are theme-aware HTML/CSS.
  - **CLI:** interactive `avo html|slides|pdf|theme` (and `-p` preview) now show a
    per-action banner — an ASCII avocado next to the action word in avocado-green
    cfonts, plus a fun status line — instead of the generic wordmark.
  - **Slides:** `fit()` now measures with `getBoundingClientRect`, so diagrams
    (incl. inline SVG) scale to fit without being clipped.
  - **Docs:** SKILL.md catalog, family sections, strict field reference, and
    block-selection tables updated for all new blocks; counts corrected to 46.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- - **Removed the `funnel` block** (catalog is now 43). Use `stats`, `gantt`, or a `table` instead.
  - **`pyramid` fixed** — wider flat apex and theme-derived colors so labels no longer get cut off.
  - **New `avo theme [name]` command** — interactive picker (with the cfonts banner) or `avo theme dark` to set it directly; writes `avodado.theme.json`, including a `custom` scaffold.
  - **`avo html` / `avo slides` / `avo pdf`** now show the avocado cfonts banner and a fun status line (interactive only).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Gap-filling blocks (inspired by replicating a rich design doc), bringing the catalog to **44**:
  - **`pullquote`** — a standout pull-quote with optional attribution.
  - **`layers`** — a layered explanation: N numbered layers, each with a kicker / title / source / question + body (e.g. an L1/L2/L3 model).
  - **`callout` gains a `success` tone** (green).
  - **`userstory` is richer** — optional `title` and `tags`, shown as a header with the points pill.

  All wired through the schema, renderer, `avo new` templates, and the authoring skill.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a dedicated **`endpoint`** block — a Swagger-style API endpoint card. One block captures an HTTP operation: `method` + `path`, optional `title`/`description`/`auth`, `params` (path/query/header/cookie), request-`body` fields, `responses` (status + description + example), and optional `request`/`response` examples. Method and status codes are colour-coded. The block catalog is now 42 types; `avo new --type endpoint` scaffolds a starter, and the authoring skill documents it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- - **Auto-layout for the coordinate diagrams.** `flow`/`dag`, `c4`, `state`, `dfd`, and `uml` no longer require `col`/`row` on every node — when coordinates are omitted, a clean layered grid is derived from the edges (dagre) so you can declare just nodes + relationships. Explicit `col`/`row` are still honored exactly (fully backward-compatible).
  - **ERD crow's-foot notation.** Relations now render proper crow's-foot ends (one / many) derived from `card`, and show the relation `label` on the edge. Added `N:1` to the `card` values (the common many-to-one shape).

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Replace the default theme with `minimal` — a clean, modern, Vercel-style look (white paper, near-black ink, a single `#0070f3` blue accent, geometric sans, subtle rounding). The `navy`/editorial theme is removed; `minimal` is now the default.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- aaa2610: Initial public release (0.0.1).
  - **@avodado/core** — parser, Zod schemas for all 41 block types, the typed block
    registry, document validator with precise diagnostics (line/column, did-you-mean,
    hints), and the cross-document reference resolver.
  - **@avodado/render** — `renderDocument` (standalone styled HTML) and
    `renderDocumentParts` (embeddable parts: CSS + body + sections) with inline SVG
    diagrams and 6 themes.
  - **@avodado/export** — HTML + PDF export (PDF via Playwright, optional).
  - **@avodado/cli** — the `avo` CLI: `init / new / check / render / preview / export /
sync`, with a code-frame diagnostics UI and the authoring skill scaffolder.
  - **@avodado/sync** — generate Avodado docs from external sources (OpenAPI).
  - **@avodado/mcp** — Model Context Protocol server exposing the doc tooling to any
    MCP client.
