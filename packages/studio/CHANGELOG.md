# @avodado/studio

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c95ee6: PowerPoint export: `avo pptx doc.md` (and a PowerPoint entry in Studio's
  Export menu) turns any doc into a real `.pptx`. Each deck slide is driven in
  headless Chromium exactly as it presents — themes, diagrams, the slide fitter —
  and photographed at 2× into a full-bleed 16:9 image slide, with slide titles
  as speaker notes. Uses the same auto-installed Chromium as `avo pdf`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- af9bae9: **Annotate sequence steps from the canvas.** Select a message in a sequence
  diagram and a "＋ add note ②" button (and an `n` shortcut, taught in the hint
  chip) opens the editor focused on that message's `summary` — the annotation
  appears automatically in the Step-by-step list under the diagram with the SAME
  reference number as the diagram badge (the list now shows real message numbers,
  so a note on step 4 reads ④ even when steps 1–3 have none). Structured edits on
  terse sugar items (arrow messages, string cards…) now materialize the item to
  its object form first instead of failing silently — annotating a one-liner
  message just works, and untouched siblings keep their terse spelling.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1dd0752: **Studio doc view now reads like the site.** A left sidebar lists the
  project's documents (the open one highlighted) with a "‹ Home" link and a
  New-doc entry — pick on the left, the doc displays and edits on the right
  (collapses on narrow windows, where the top-bar switcher takes over). And the
  cover is its own edit surface: hover the rendered cover for an "✎ Edit cover"
  chip and click to open the cover editor — the detached gray placeholder strip
  is gone. Keyboard block-roving starts at the first real block.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f8b303a: **Streamlined Studio navigation — no modes to learn.** The Home | Edit | Site |
  Present segmented switch is gone. Studio is now just pages and actions, like a
  website: **Home** (the doc grid — click the wordmark to return) → click a card
  and you're **in the doc**, viewing and editing the same rendered surface.
  **▶ Present** is a button (⇧⌘P, Esc returns), and **Site ↗** opens the built
  docs site in its own browser tab — pointed at the current doc when you're in
  one. The top bar stays contextual: editing chrome only appears inside a doc.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c56f620: **Studio opens on a Home page** — a front page for your docs, like a site
  landing. A searchable card grid (most recently edited first) with each doc's
  title, slug, and last-edited time; click a card to edit, hover for a one-click
  Present; a dashed "New doc" card opens the template picker; "Browse the site"
  jumps to Site mode. The wordmark is now a Home button, the mode switch gains
  Home | Edit | Site | Present, and the top bar hides doc-editing chrome (save
  state, autosave, export, undo) while on Home.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 0d9c992: **Callouts (and pullquotes) are now just text.** A text-first block's body can
  be plain prose — no YAML at all, so colons, quotes and dashes never need
  escaping:

      ```callout
      Heads up: the rate limit is 100 req/min — use `retry()` with **backoff**.
      ```

  The whole body becomes the block's text field (callout `body`, pullquote
  `text`), and it renders as inline Markdown (bold/italic/code/links, blank lines
  as paragraph breaks — hardened, no raw HTML). Leading with a known field
  (`tone:`, `title:`, `id:`…) still parses as YAML exactly as before. Studio's
  structured edits canonicalize a bare-text body to explicit fields instead of
  failing.

  **Typography: reading text is bigger.** Body prose 14 → 15.5px, list items
  13.5 → 15px, callout body 13 → 14.5px, glossary/diagram descriptions 13 → 14px,
  section ledes 15.5 → 16px.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d143316: Add a **Theme Generator** to Avodado Studio. A "Theme" button in the toolbar
  opens a right-docked panel where you pick a base theme and tune the 11 friendly
  colors + 3 font slots, with the canvas re-tinting live as you edit. **Install**
  writes a `*.theme.json` into the project's `.avodado/themes` (or `~/.avodado/themes`
  for a global theme) via a new `POST /api/theme` route on the file bridge, and
  activates it — so it immediately appears in the theme picker and in `avo theme`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ebdf605: Studio, rendering, and package metadata.

  **Studio**
  - Toolbar **Export** menu: download the current doc as a standalone HTML page,
    a self-contained slide deck, or a PDF. PDF is produced by a new
    `POST /api/export/pdf` route on the file-bridge server (headless Chromium).
  - **ERD drag-to-connect:** selecting an entity shows connector dots; dragging
    to another entity opens a cardinality picker (1:1 / 1:N / N:1 / N:M) that
    appends the relation. Committed as a single undo step.
  - Direct-manipulation editing for grid groups (marquee select + resize) and
    column-family blocks.

  **Rendering**
  - New `cycle` block and grid-group / orthogonal-lane / label-wrap improvements
    across the diagram renderers.

  **Metadata**
  - SEO-focused `description` + `keywords` across all packages, framed around the
    real use cases: API docs, architecture & system design, ERDs, ADRs, and
    slide/PDF presentations.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Custom themes become first-class, and the wordmark goes full avocado.
  - Fixed: installing or referencing a custom theme no longer fails with
    "theme must be one of:" — `avodado.theme.json` accepts built-in names,
    installed theme names, and self-titled theme files; unresolvable names get
    an error listing your installed themes alongside the built-ins.
  - Fixed: the studio theme picker now lists every installed theme (project and
    global) next to the six built-ins, with the on-disk theme selected on load.
  - Fixed: changing the theme while studio is open (including `avo theme
--global`, which previously emitted no change event) repaints live, with a
    "Theme changed on disk — applied" note. In-studio picks are session
    previews; the file on disk stays the source of truth.
  - The `avo init` wordmark is now chunky block letters in the avocado-green
    gradient, matching the per-command action banners.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Simplification: 76 block types, terser YAML, a smaller CLI, and a sharper story — with zero breaking changes.

  **88 → 76 block types, 12 permanent aliases.** Twelve blocks that were variants of another block merged into their canonical type: `infra`/`event`/`ddd`/`network` → `block` (`preset:`), `belogic` → `felogic` (`variant: be`), `dag` → `flow` (`variant: dag`), `waterfall`/`funnel` → `chart` (`kind:`), `diff`/`terminal` → `code` (`kind:`), `mece` → `tree` (`variant: issue`), `tracker` → `statustable` (`variant: tracker`). **The old spellings stay valid forever**: an aliased fence parses to its canonical type with the variant fields injected (your body always wins on conflict), renders byte-identically to before (pinned parity fixtures), keeps its historical section eyebrow, and survives studio editing untouched. `avo check` surfaces a `W_ALIAS_TYPE` warning — informational only, never a failure — telling you where the type lives now. No file needs to change. (Further merges the audits suggested — matrix→table, heatmap→chart, gantt→timeline, and friends — were rejected: their data shapes are structurally different, and forcing them would have bolted second grammars onto flagship blocks.)

  **YAML sugar.** The chattiest blocks now take one-line string forms alongside the object form: sequence messages and flow/graph/block edges (`Client -> Server: request`, `-->` for response/dashed, `-x->` for error), ERD relations in crow's-foot (`users ||--o{ orders: places`), and timeline items (`[done] 2026-07 · Phase 1 · What shipped`). Input-only — files keep whatever form you wrote.

  **Scalar coercion.** Bare numbers and booleans in string-only positions coerce automatically — "expected string, received number" is gone where the intent was unambiguous, and positions that legitimately take numbers (table cells, stats values) are protected.

  **CLI redesign.** Twenty commands became ~13 in four groups — Work (`avo`, `init`, `new`, `check`, `studio`, `serve`), Output (`html`, `slides`, `pdf`, `build`), Discover (`explore`), Setup (`install`, `theme`, `mcp`, `sync`). Bare `avo` is now smart: outside a project it points you at `avo init`; inside one it shows a mini status and your next actions. `avo <file.md>` renders and opens the file. `avo new` unifies doc templates and block scaffolds (`avo new adr`, `avo new sequence` — old names resolve with an alias note). `avo explore` fronts demo/catalog/design/tour. Old command names keep working as hidden compat. `avo init` writes ~30 files instead of 104: the authoring skill installs once at `.avodado/skill/` and each AI tool gets a small pointer stub instead of a full copy.

  **Studio.** "+ New doc" opens a template picker — Blank plus the 11 doc templates (ADR, design doc, runbook, API spec, …) as cards; picking one creates the doc and opens the first content block's Edit Sheet so Tab/Enter walks you through filling it in. Insert search understands the old spellings: typing "waterfall" surfaces "Data chart — matches waterfall (kind: waterfall)" and inserts a chart with the variant pre-filled.

  **Positioning.** The lede everywhere is now the point: _your documentation has a schema_ — typed, fenced YAML blocks in plain Markdown, validated like code, with the `.md` files on disk as the only source of truth.

  `@avodado/mcp` picks up the regenerated skill embed and `list_block_types` now returns the canonical 76 plus the alias map.

- Studio becomes the single local surface, imports arrive, and the official mark
  ships everywhere.
  - studio: **Edit · Site · Present modes** — Site browses the real built docs
    site (live-reloading, cross-doc nav) inside studio; Present (⇧⌘P) shows the
    current doc as slides, unsaved edits included. **Block Library** — browse all
    blocks as cards with rendered previews, filter by family/search (old block
    spellings resolve), click through to a full preview + template and insert in
    one step. **Import by drag-drop**: a `.csv` becomes a filled table /
    status table / chart at the drop point (smart suggestion with reasoning); an
    OpenAPI `.yaml`/`.json` scaffolds a whole validated doc. Forms-first editing
    (spreadsheet-style table grid, Simple|Detailed union fields) and an
    interactive 9-step tour.
  - core: new `import/` module — dependency-free RFC-4180 CSV engine
    (`csvToTable` / `csvToStatustable` / `csvToChart` / `suggestCsvImport`), the
    OpenAPI generator relocated from the CLI (one source for cli, mcp, studio),
    and an importer registry.
  - cli: `avo sync csv <file>` (smart block pick, `--block/--delimiter/--title`);
    `avo serve` is now a hidden alias — `avo studio` (Site mode) is the one local
    surface.
  - render: every rendered page, deck, and site now carries the official avodado
    mark as its favicon.
  - mcp: imports the OpenAPI generator from core (vendored copy removed).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Brand favicon + studio review-before-write mode.
  - render: new brand exports (`FAVICON_SVG`, `FAVICON_DATA_URI`, `FAVICON_LINK`)
    — a clean avocado favicon, now on every rendered page (`avo html`/`preview`).
  - cli: `avo serve`/`avo build` pages and slide decks carry the favicon.
  - studio: the tab icon matches; **review mode** — with autosave off, the save
    chip reads "Unsaved · N changes" and saving opens a review dialog listing
    edited / added / removed / reordered blocks with Apply / Cancel, so nothing
    touches the file until approved. Deleting a block or diagram part asks first
    (double-⌫ confirms; pristine just-inserted scaffolding deletes silently).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- `avo studio` — the visual doc editor. A full-screen local web app served by the
  CLI: insert blocks from the searchable palette into a live-rendered canvas, edit them
  via schema-generated forms or raw YAML, reorder with drag handles, and watch AI
  edits to the same files repaint live over SSE. Files on disk stay the single
  source of truth — studio surgically rewrites individual fenced blocks.
  - core: new surgical edit ops (`replaceBlockBody`, `insertBlock`, `removeSegment`,
    `moveSegment`, `setYamlPath`, …), schema introspection (`describeBlockSchema`),
    and the block catalog data (`BLOCK_TEMPLATES`, `BLOCK_DESCRIPTIONS`,
    `BLOCK_FAMILY`) relocated from the CLI as public API.
  - render: `renderDocumentSegments` — per-segment HTML index-aligned with
    `doc.segments`, for editors that need DOM↔segment mapping.
  - cli: new `avo studio` command — a localhost-only file-bridge server (JSON API +
    SSE + static app assets); shared fs-watch helpers extracted into `io/watch.ts`.
  - studio: first release of the web app (published as static assets consumed by
    the CLI).
