# @avodado/cli

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- ERD relations now connect at the **field level** — each edge is routed from the foreign-key row in the source entity to the primary-key row in the target entity (arrowhead into the PK row), instead of attaching at the box centre. dagre still handles box placement; edges route orthogonally through the gap between boxes.
- Updated dependencies
  - @avodado/render@0.1.2
  - @avodado/export@0.0.5

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- - **ERD block remodeled** — entity placement and edge routing are now computed with a real graph-layout pass (dagre), so boxes don't overlap and relations route cleanly around them instead of cutting across the diagram. Foreign keys still point an arrowhead into the target entity (FK → PK), with cardinality labels on the edges. Entities longer than 10 columns are truncated with a "… +N more" row for readability.
  - **Textbook theme now uses a sans-serif typeface** (warm palette, larger headings, and cream paper are unchanged).
- Updated dependencies
  - @avodado/render@0.1.1
  - @avodado/export@0.0.4

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- - **New default theme `textbook`** — a warm, classic, printed-page look: cream paper, deep academic navy + terracotta accent, serif display & body, and larger headings. The former default is still available as the `minimal` theme.
  - **ERD foreign keys now connect FK → PK** — relations attach to the foreign-key row in the source entity and point an arrowhead into the primary-key row of the target (instead of generic top-edge arrows). ERD colors now follow the active theme.
  - **`avo init` installs one unified skill across tools** — the same `avodado-docs` skill (`SKILL.md`) is written into each tool's native skill location (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) plus a Copilot prompt file, and **agents** are generated where supported (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot). Instruction files are now consistent pointers.
  - Removed the dead `$schema` URL from the scaffolded `avodado.config.json`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @avodado/render@0.1.0
  - @avodado/export@0.0.3

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix `avo --version` (and the help banner) reporting a hard-coded `0.0.1` — the CLI now reads its real version from its own package.json.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Interactive `avo init`: a guided wizard (with a cfonts AVODADO banner) that asks which AI tools you use — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf — and writes only those editor adapters, then lets you pick a theme (with a Custom option that scaffolds `avodado.theme.json`). Pass `--yes` to skip the wizard and scaffold with defaults (CI/non-interactive).

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Replace the default theme with `minimal` — a clean, modern, Vercel-style look (white paper, near-black ink, a single `#0070f3` blue accent, geometric sans, subtle rounding). The `navy`/editorial theme is removed; `minimal` is now the default.
- Updated dependencies
  - @avodado/core@0.0.2
  - @avodado/render@0.0.2
  - @avodado/export@0.0.2
  - @avodado/sync@0.0.2

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- aaa2610: Initial public release (0.0.1).
  - **@avodado/core** — parser, Zod schemas for all 41 block types, the typed block
    registry, document validator with precise diagnostics (line/column, did-you-mean,
    hints), and the cross-document reference resolver.
  - **@avodado/render** — `renderDocument` (standalone styled HTML) and
    `renderDocumentParts` (embeddable parts: CSS + body + sections) with inline SVG
    diagrams and 6 themes.
  - **@avodado/export** — HTML + PDF export (PDF via Playwright, optional).
  - **@avodado/cli** — the `avo` CLI: `init / new / check / render / preview / export /
sync`, with a code-frame diagnostics UI and the authoring skill scaffolder.
  - **@avodado/sync** — generate Avodado docs from external sources (OpenAPI).
  - **@avodado/mcp** — Model Context Protocol server exposing the doc tooling to any
    MCP client.
