subtitle: The request path, the event backbone, the data plane, and the third parties at the edge — on one page.
tag: EXAMPLE
```

One `block` diagram carries the whole platform. Groups mark each plane. Node kinds draw as the shapes a design review expects: a load-balancer bar, cylinders, pipes, clouds. Replicas stack as cards, and dense flows get numbers and a legend.

## The platform on one page

Every node is one line of YAML. The renderer chose the shapes, routed the arrows, numbered the labelled flows, and built the legend.
